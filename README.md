# Learning Java

This is my personal repository created for learning the Java programming language step by step. I will try to regularly perform various Java programming tasks and post them here. Each task will be accompanied by its description.

Each task will be placed in a separate package corresponding to the task number: `task1`, `task2`, `task3`, and so on. All tasks will be organized in the `JavaTasks` folder.

Welcome to my learning journey!
